| **1** | **Industry Visit 1 (UTM Digital Day),Assignment 1** | On 5th November 2025, my team and I attended the UTM Digital Open Day, where I gained valuable insights into the role of AI in the modern era. The main highlight was when I spoke to company marketing partners at the booths, specifically Microsoft's where they informed me about the benefits of using Copilot AI. Personally, I feel like I should've joined every other sharing session in the Insight X series so that maybe I could've learnt more. That would be a good thing to do next year.  |
| **2** | **PC Assemble Lab** | I thoroughly enjoyed the lab session and am grateful for the opportunity to participate. It was a rewarding experience that broadened my perspective, particularly as I gained hands-on knowledge of assembling a personal computer. I was able to identify and understand the functions of various components such as the power supply, RAM modules, and the intricate connections between wires and hardware. Following the practical session, we also completed a quiz to reinforce what we had learned, which further enhanced the overall experience. This lab was both educational and engaging, and I truly appreciated being part of it. I really dont think I have anything to improve on over here. Everything went well as I paid full attention during the session|
| **3** | **Industry Talk 1,Assignment 2** | The talk highlighted how PPG operates as an “invisible giant,” exerting influence across diverse sectors ranging from consumer goods to aerospace. I gained valuable insights into their “Plan, Build, Run” operational framework and their strategic transition toward a “Cloud-only” infrastructure. One of the most striking lessons was the contrast between the structured, “clean data” often encountered in academia and the vast, complex datasets managed in industry, which require advanced SQL proficiency and robust database management skills. This experience has inspired me to further develop my expertise in database systems, equipping myself for both my Final Year Project and my future professional endeavors. Personally, I feel like I could've studied cloud systems and database beforehand so I could've been better equipped and I could've understood the explanations with ease by doing so.  |
| **4** | **Industry Talk 2,Assigment 3** | This session profoundly reshaped my understanding of success in the field of Computer Science. I realized that true achievement requires not only technical proficiency but also the ability to communicate effectively and adapt to change. The comparison between Waterfall and Agile methodologies, seen through the lens of lifestyle planning, demonstrated the importance of resilience when navigating unexpected challenges. Looking ahead to the next four years, I am committed to pursuing a dual path of development: advancing my coding expertise while simultaneously cultivating teamwork and problem-solving skills. Through this balanced approach, I aim to build practical, impactful applications that bridge academic knowledge with real-world needs. I will also involve myself in Hackathons and CTF to gain experience in solving real world problems.  |
| **5** | **Industry Visit 2,Assignment 4** |During my visit to Johor Port, I acquired valuable insights into the logistics industry and the sophisticated management of organizational workflows. I was particularly impressed by the port’s integrated digital ecosystem, enterprise systems, and secure access protocols. Gaining exposure to their resilient infrastructure and advanced cybersecurity measures was especially enlightening, as it demonstrated how cutting-edge technologies and specialized techniques are implemented in a real-world industrial environment. Furthermore, I was intrigued to discover the wide range of career opportunities available for fresh graduates, as well as the internship programs offered to university students. Overall, this visit proved to be both inspiring and highly educational. I dont see any room for imrpovement here, if anything I will spend more time to learn more about IT operations done in industrial areas like Johor Port to learn more about real world usage of technology and information systems.|
| **6** | **Design Thinking** | Through this design thinking project, I gained valuable experience in the process of developing an interactive application. Although the outcome was only a prototype, I was impressed by how my group members and I were able to bring our ideas to life through teamwork and collaboration. I was tasked with programming the prototype. It was slightly difficult for me at first, since it was my first time writing HTML code after a long time(last used HTML in 2020). However, I eventually jumped back on track thanks to my memory of how HTML works. Following the completion of the prototype, we were tasked with preparing a report from multiple perspectives, including the feedback session, testing phase, and the overall purpose of the application. I found this stage particularly engaging, as it clearly demonstrated how our collective efforts and creativity were embodied in the final product. Finally, we presented our prototype in class. Having complete understanding of the project and prototype we developed, we managed to answer all the questions thrown at us during the QnA session. In fact, it increased my confidence. If anything, I believe that we could've done this project in a better way if I had practiced HTML before engaging with the project. I will do better in the future. |
